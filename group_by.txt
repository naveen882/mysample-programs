Group By X means put all those with the same value for X in the one group.

Group By X, Y means put all those with the same values for both X and Y in the one group.

To illustrate using an example, let's say we have the following table, to do with who is attending what subject at a university:

Table: Subject_Selection

Subject   Semester   Attendee
---------------------------------
ITB001    1          John
ITB001    1          Bob
ITB001    1          Mickey
ITB001    2          Jenny
ITB001    2          James
MKB114    1          John
MKB114    1          Erica

When you use a group by on the subject column only; say:

select Subject, Count(*)
from Subject_Selection
group by Subject

You will get something like:

Subject    Count
------------------------------
ITB001     5
MKB114     2

...because there are 5 entries for ITB001, and 2 for MKB114

If we were to group by two columns:

select Subject, Semester, Count(*)
from Subject_Selection
group by Subject, Semester

we would get this:

Subject    Semester   Count
------------------------------
ITB001     1          3
ITB001     2          2
MKB114     1          2
