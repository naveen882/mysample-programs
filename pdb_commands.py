import pdb
# https://pythonconquerstheuniverse.wordpress.com/2009/09/10/debugging-in-python/
# n for next line of code
# q for quitting pdb
# l list 11 lines of code
# c for continue, it will end the program if no pdb_trace is found or it will execute all the other code in the loop and will again halt at pdb_trace()
# s is for stepping into subroutine or functions
# r is for returning from the subroutine or better "continue until return"
# In the following when we encounter that the next line is the function then to step into that
# function and debug it we can use 's'
# ex: /home/naveen/pg/mysample-programs/epdb1.py(32)<module>()
#    -> final = combine(a, b)
#    (Pdb) s

# One of the nice things about the (Pdb) prompt is that you can do anything at it â€” you can enter
# any command that you like at the (Pdb) prompt. So you can, for instance, enter this command at the
# (Pdb) prompt.
# (Pdb) var1 = "bbb"
